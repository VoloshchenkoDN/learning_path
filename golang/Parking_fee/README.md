I recently came across an interesting concept posted  by @Akkarawut 5105 in Q&A, and thought to share it here as a challenge.

Calculate the parking fee according to the following criteria.
1. First 20 minutes is free
2. If you stay longer than 20 minutes, then you must pay $10 for the hour, or part thereof.
3. If you stay longer than 1 hr, you must pay $20 per hour or part thereof.
4. If you stay 3 or more hrs, then you must pay $40 /hr or part thereof.

Examples:
15 minutes -> free
30 minutes -> $10 (1Ã—10)
65 minutes -> $40  (2Ã—20)
115 minutes -> $40 (2Ã—20)
125 minutes -> $120 (3Ã—40)
181 minutes -> $160 (4Ã—40)

Sounds easy!
